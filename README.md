Hello World!

This is my maiden voyage into the "the hub", as they call it.  Do they call it that? They should.

I've been studying software development for almost four months now.  So far, I've learned basic html, css and javascript.

Since graduating college, I haven't spent much time around computers, so self-teaching coding has been an uphill challenge.  But I am fully enjoying the journey.  

I'm not sure which direction I'll take my studying once I finish javascript, but I've always enjoyed poker and think it would be fun to learn poker software.

Maybe make a training app that teaches hand ranges, pot odds and equity?  Sounds hard, but a fella can dream!

That's all for now.

Goodbye World!
